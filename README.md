 ### **Satyam Bhardwaj**
###  **Anish Bhanu**


## Getting Started:
**install the package from**:
**https://test.pypi.org/project/transform/0.2/** and start using

## import transform as tf

### tf.bres(starting x, starting y, end x, end y) -> line drawing using bresenhems algorithm.

### tf.dda(starting x, starting y, end x, end y) -> line drawing using Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm.

### tf.circle( cx, cy, radius ) -> draws a circle
'cx' is x coordinate of circle, 'cy' is y coordinate of circle.

### tf.rotate(Xpoints, Ypoints, radians, "c(forClockwise, else "a")", origin) -> for rotation
'Xpoints' is a python list of x coordinates of the figure.
'Ypoints' is a python list of y coordinates of the figure.

and much more..
